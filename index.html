          <span><b>Abdul Qadeer Khan</b></span> (born April 1, 1936, Bhopal, Indiaâ€”died
          October 10, 2021, Islamabad, Pakistan) Pakistani engineer, a key
          figure in Pakistan's nuclear weapons program who was also involved for
          decades in a black market of nuclear technology and know-how whereby
          uranium-enrichment centrifuges, nuclear warhead designs, missiles, and
          expertise were sold or traded to Iran, North Korea, Libya, and
          possibly other countries.His journey underscores the ethical dilemmas
          inherent in scientific pursuits within the context of global security.
          Despite the controversies surrounding him, Khan's story serves as a
          reminder of the fine line between scientific progress and its
          potential misuse. His legacy prompts ongoing discussions on nuclear
          non-proliferation efforts and the responsibilities of scientists in
          shaping geopolitical landscapes. Furthermore, it highlights the
          importance of international cooperation and diplomacy in managing the
          risks associated with nuclear technology. Khan's life also raises
          questions about the role of individual agency in scientific endeavors
          and the accountability of scientists to society.
